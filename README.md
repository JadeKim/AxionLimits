# AxionLimits
Jupyter notebook for plotting all existing limits on the axion-photon coupling, as well as some projected limits. All limits should be referenced in the comments of the notebook. Hopefully this should help anyone from having to digitise plots and whatnot. Email me if you think something is missing.
